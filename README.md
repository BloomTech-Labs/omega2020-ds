## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/NyKQYmbB/labs-pt11-omega2020)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/980697b5f8bf481db26a8dd57e393aeb?v=5fecee4136ae4e69b228b84f810610c2)

The Omega2020 DS API serves as the backbone for image processing and computer vision pipelines to enable a better experience of transferring analog paper Sudoku puzzles to a digital form.

[Deployed Front End](http://omega2020.netlify.com/)

### Tech Stack

Below is an annotated breakout of the Cloud Architecture for the Omega 2020 Solution. Each step is also explained below.

[<img src="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/omega2020-ds/blob/master/readme_files/Omega2020%20-%20Annotated.png"/>](https://cloudcraft.co/view/7b1de017-7406-43f3-a54e-682fcdc7b28f?key=ZZYfXAD9cYsLAA_galrUGw)

* (Black Arrow) - Standard Inflow of Data for uploading a Paper Sudoku Puzzle
* (Orange Arrow) - Querying a Sudoku Puzzle String to solve
* (Green Arrow) - Responses to Front End

Data Pipeline:
1. Web Team's Front end Deployed on Netlify at Omega2020.netlify.com
2. Elastic Beanstalk endpoint, redirected from an HTTPS: hosted website.
3. Auto scales between 1-4 servers to be able to handle spikes in demand.

4. Entrypoint to Flask App
    * **(Black Arrow)** First entry point within the Flask App, posts the raw image to S3.
    * **(Orange Arrow)** Passes Puzzle string To Solver
5. After the raw image is uploaded, it goes the Image Processing Script. Cropping out the Sudoku Puzzle from the image background, and subdivides a Sudoku Puzzle to 81 cells, stored as a list of 81 Numpy Arrays. Each Numpy Array is 784 integers long, representing a 28x28 pixel image.
6. Solver Module
    * **(Orange Arrow)** With Digits Passed via GET request from front end, solver checks if submitted Sudoku Puzzle is valid, if valid, the solution is passed as well as forecasted difficulty.
    * **(Green Arrow)** With predicted digits passed back from Sagemaker API Endpoint, solver checks if submitted Sudoku Puzzle is valid, if valid, the solution is passed as well as forecasted difficulty. 
7. Amazon API Endpoint called for Analysis. Acts as a handler between Flask App and Sagemaker back end.
8. Lambda Function receives URL metadata from the API Gateway, and transforms it into the Sagemaker format.
9. Amazon Sagemaker Scores the inbound predictions.
10. S3 Bucket is organized into different folders of Raw Images, Processed Images, Individual Sudoku Cells, 

Auxiliary Services:

* A. AWS Ground Truth was used to initially bootstrap the training of our model where our team individually scored 5,000 digits from a Sudoku Puzzle Book.
* B. The Sagemaker Train Function reads a specific folder in the S3 Bucket, and runs on a scheduled basis allowing **Omega2020 learns over time as more data is shared.**
* C. Reference Puzzles generated from our scraper is pulled on request to the front end, organized by difficulty.


###  Models:

#### Digit Recognition
##### Using an XGBClassifier model, we a weighted have Digit recognition at +95% precision and recall across all classes, trained on over 100,000 images (combination of manually scrapped and MNIST), and a validation dataset of over 25,000 digits. Here is an output of our most recent classification report and validation score: (0.0 represents blank/noise cells that are not any single number)

```
Validation Accuracy 0.9552200984651028

##### Image Processing Pipeline
Here is an example of the intermediary steps for taking a raw image and formatting it in such a way for digit recognition.

Each Cell is then casted into a Numpy Array (each cell is 28x28 pixels, reshaped to a Numpy vector with length 784) and then fed into the Model.

Predicted Sudoku Grid and Solution Grid.

**Note: For the modeling, the "blank" classifier is a `0`, but for the front end it is a `.` .**

#### Sudoku Puzzle Difficulty Model:

##### To predict the difficulty level of a Sudoku we used a Logistic Regression, by counting the number of times different techniques are used to solve a given puzzle, we can forecast an accurate difficulty tracking at above 70%.

```

#### Deployment

This app as structured is intended to be deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The .ebextensions folder contains configuration for CORS as well as HTTPS certification, but requires an updated Role with the ARN linked to the AWS Certificate Manager role for the signed SSL certificate. (SSL Is required to work in production with netlify, as netlify will not accept HTTP traffic).
